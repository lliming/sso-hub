             <h2>Privacy policy</h2>

             <p>{{pagetitle}} does not collect or keep copies of any of your identity data. 
                The only record this web server keeps regarding your use of this application is the
                web server log, which records any pages accessed and the IP address of your browser. Your
                identity is not included in the log. Your SSH access tokens are never stored on the web 
                server.</p>

             <p>All data about you and your use of this application&mdash;including SSH access tokens&mdash;is 
                stored in a "cookie" in your web browser. The cookie is encrypted and this is the only website 
                that can decrypt it. The cookie is sent to the server with every page load so the server can generate 
                the interface for you. After each page is generated, the server discards the cookie data.</p>

             <p>When you login to {{pagetitle}}, neither Globus nor {{pagetitle}} can
                see the information you give your identity provider to login.</p>

             <p>This privacy policy applies only to the {{pagetitle}} web app. It <b>does not</b> apply to 
                any SSH servers you connect to.</p>
