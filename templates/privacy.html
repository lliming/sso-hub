             <p>{{pagetitle}} does not collect or keep copies of any of your identity data. 
                The web server keeps no record of your use of this application. Your SSH

             <p>All data about you and your use of this application&mdash;including SSH access tokens&mdash;is 
                stored in a "cookie" in your web browser. The cookie is encrypted and this is the only website 
                that can decrypt it. The cookie is sent to the server with every page load so the server can generate 
                the interface for you. After each page is generated, the server discards the cookie data.</p>
